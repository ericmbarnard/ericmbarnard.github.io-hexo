Hi, I'm Eric Barnard.

To me, a great day starts with a fresh pot of coffee and ends with something accomplished. I currently live in Champaign, IL, where I focus on trying to make a living within the software development and technology industry.

I grew up on a farm in central Indiana, fully experienced [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), sharpened my skills with the [Orr Fellowship](http://orrfellowship.org/) in Indianapolis, got married, then landed in Champaign-Urbana, IL where [my wife](https://jessamarieb.wordpress.com/) enjoys her dream job with the University of Illinois.

I currently work for myself as a free-lance software consultant, and have a role with [Parkland College](http://wwww.parkland.edu) as an instructor within their CSIT Department.
