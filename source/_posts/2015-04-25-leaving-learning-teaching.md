Today is my last day at Codagami. It's been almost exactly 3 years since I started, and I can't say enough about how much I've learned and grown over those three years. I'm moving on for a multitude of reasons - some bigger than others and some smaller - nothing bad. Most importantly, though, I'm moving on to continue growing and challenging myself in new directions.

##The Details##
First, I'm leaving because eventually I'll be starting a new position with our local community college, [Parkland College](http://www.parkland.edu/) as an instructor in their Computer Science and Information Technology department. I'm taking this position because I've always loved the teaching experiences I've had with any role I've been in and I've wanted to get closer to that area with my career moves than further. I'll start by teaching a summer course or two and then begin full-time teaching in the fall.

As part of the new role I'll be taking with Parkland, I am being given the opportunity to help coordinate some major updates to their software development curriculum and programs. I realize this will be a lot of work, but at the end of the day I am pretty stoked about the idea that I'll be able to apply my industry experience into the degree programs we'll be offering. The challenge of trying to build an ever-evolving curriculum that keeps up with an industry that changes as quickly as ours is definitely not going to be easy - but as I've gotten older I've realized those are the types of challenges that make me want to get up in the morning.

So, you might be wondering... what on earth am I going to be doing between now and the fall (and the future summers for that matter)? Well - I'll be working for myself.  This actually supplements my new role quite well, as staying in-tune with the industry from both a technical and relationship level will continue to give me that *"real-world"* experience I'll need as I work with students and develop curriculum.

I'm actively looking for and taking on small projects here and there to keep myself busy and stay as knee-deep in the software development industry as I can. I've got some work lined up currently and will continue to try to seek out cool projects that I can learn from (if you have any - please feel free to reach out). I will be setting up a business entity and doing all that sorts of stuff over the next few weeks - so stay tuned.
