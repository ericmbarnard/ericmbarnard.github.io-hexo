I'm pretty excited to announce that my first book, [KnockoutJS Starter](http://www.packtpub.com/knockoutjs-starter/book), was recently published. If my blog looked dead for the past several months, it was due to this little project (and a few other things).

Please check it out and leave any feedback/comments here. I would like to write another JavaScript book and constructive feedback would be really appreciated!
