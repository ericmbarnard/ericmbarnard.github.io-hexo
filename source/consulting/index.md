I love building and enhancing web applications (or really any software for that matter)! I am glad to help folks looking for assistance with most any software needs!

I carry experience in things like:
- Large Enterprise-level JavaScript front-end architecture (apps with 100+ pages)
- Single Page JavaScript Application architecture (SPA)
- jQuery custom plugins and widgets
- KnockoutJS architectures (where I maintain multiple KnockoutJS plugin and control libraries)
- AngularJS architectures
- Modular ASP.NET MVC Architecture and Development
- ASP.NET Webforms Architecture and Development
- SQL Server Database Design and Migrations
- Data-Migration Planning and Execution (MS Access/Excel to SQL Server, SQL Server to SQL Server, etc...)

Much of my experience lies in developing secure sites for businesses and the enterprise. If you are interested, I would be glad to show you examples of past work (or you can check my GitHub account)

I work for a really sweet company that carries the same passions that I do. I'd love to sit down and talk about any (or all) of the following:
* **Project Scoping**: What's your current state? Where do yo want to get to? And what steps are we going to need to get there?
* **Design Specs**: Have an idea in mind but need someone technical to spell it out for Development?
* **JavaScript Development**: Have some ideas for some really sweet JavaScript widgets or plugins... but you're not sure how to build them or where to start?
* **Application Development**: Need a solid, secure, and maintainable website/application built up to the tip of today's standards? Oh and you need it to work on tablets and phones?
